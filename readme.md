# Visualized Sudoku Solver

This is a sudoku solver implemented by Python3 using backtracking algorithm. Currently it is still a prototype. I plan to add more features to it.



## Get Started

run the only file in this repo. I use Windows10.

```bash
py sudoku.py
```

Then you will see a solving process of a hard-code sudoku puzzle(I plan to add a puzzle generator in this project), with detailed description on what to do each step.



## Todo

1. GUI Interface, visualization.
2. Puzzle Generator
3. Optimization, more readable code, etc.
4. Other algorithms(maybe?)
